# Step 5: Deliver

**Progress: Step 5 of 5** — Final Step

**AUTONOMOUS VERIFICATION — then present results to user.**

## RULES

- MUST verify all ACs from all stories.
- MUST fix any issues found during verification before presenting results.
- MUST present a comprehensive summary of everything generated.
- YOU MUST ALWAYS communicate in `{communication_language}`.

---

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### 1. Self-Check Audit

**Status update:** "Running verification..."

Walk through each story and verify:

a) **Tasks Complete**
- All tasks in `{epics_path}` marked `[x]`
- No tasks skipped without documented reason

b) **Acceptance Criteria**
- For each AC in each story, verify the implementation satisfies it
- Note any AC that is not fully met

c) **Code Quality**
- Architecture patterns followed consistently
- Error handling is appropriate
- No obvious bugs, missing imports, or syntax errors
- Files properly structured per architecture doc

d) **Tests**
- Tests written where the architecture specifies
- Tests cover happy path and key edge cases

e) **Project Completeness**
- All dependencies listed and installable
- Configuration files complete
- README or documentation covers how to run the project

### 2. Fix Issues

If the audit finds issues:
- Fix them immediately
- Update the affected files
- Note what was fixed

### 3. Construct Diff Summary

**If `{baseline_commit}` is a Git commit hash:**

```bash
git diff --stat {baseline_commit}
```

**If `{baseline_commit}` is "NO_GIT":**

List all files created or modified during steps 2-4.

### 4. Present Complete Summary

Display a comprehensive report:

```
============================================================
  BMAD Auto — Project Complete!
============================================================

**{project_name}**

------------------------------------------------------------
ARTIFACTS GENERATED
------------------------------------------------------------

  Product Brief:  {brief_path}
  PRD:            {prd_path}
  Architecture:   {architecture_path}
  Epics/Stories:  {epics_path}

------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------

  Epics completed:    {epic_count}
  Stories completed:   {story_count}
  Files created:       {files_created}
  Files modified:      {files_modified}

  **Key files:**
  {list of main files with brief description}

------------------------------------------------------------
TECH STACK
------------------------------------------------------------

  {tech stack summary from architecture}

------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WAS BUILT
------------------------------------------------------------

  {functional summary — what the app does, organized by feature}

------------------------------------------------------------
ASSUMPTIONS MADE
------------------------------------------------------------

  {numbered list of key assumptions across all artifacts}

------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

  {any gaps, deferred features, or issues noted during implementation}

============================================================
```

### 5. Propose Next Actions

```
**What's next?**

[C] Commit all changes
[T] Run tests
[R] Review a specific file or artifact
[F] Fix something
[D] Done — nothing else needed
```

**HALT and wait for user selection.**

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- **[C] Commit:** Stage all changes and propose commit message:
  ```
  feat: {project_name} — complete project generated by BMAD Auto

  Artifacts: Product Brief, PRD, Architecture, Epics & Stories
  Implementation: {story_count} stories across {epic_count} epics
  ```
  Ask user to confirm message, then commit.

- **[T] Run tests:** Execute the project's test command and report results, then re-display menu.

- **[R] Review:** Ask which file or artifact to review, display it, then re-display menu.

- **[F] Fix:** Ask what to fix, apply the fix, then re-display menu.

- **[D] Done:** Display final message:
  "Your project is ready! All artifacts and code are in place. Happy building!"

---

## WORKFLOW COMPLETE

This is the final step. The BMAD Auto Flow is now complete.

## SUCCESS METRICS

- All stories verified against ACs
- Issues found and fixed
- Comprehensive summary presented
- User has clear next actions
- All artifacts documented with assumptions
- Project is in a runnable state (or as close as possible)
